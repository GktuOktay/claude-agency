# Daily Standup Generator Guidelines

This skill defines how to aggregate, filter, and format development progress into professional daily standup reports. The goal is to provide maximum visibility with minimal reading time.

## 1. Core Formatting (The 3 Pillars)

Every standup report must follow a strict, scannable format divided into three core sections:

### **Yesterday (Ne Yaptım?)**
Focus on completed work and measurable progress.
- Use bullet points.
- Start with strong action verbs (e.g., *Implemented, Fixed, Refactored, Reviewed*).
- Include ticket/issue numbers or links where applicable.

### **Today (Ne Yapacağım?)**
Focus on the immediate priorities for the current day.
- Be specific about the expected outcome (e.g., *Finalize the API endpoint* instead of *Work on API*).
- Mention any meetings or cross-team collaborations planned.

### **Blockers (Engeller)**
Highlight anything preventing progress.
- Be clear about *who* or *what* you are waiting for.
- If there are no blockers, state: "None" or "No blockers." Do not omit the section.

## 2. Extracting Progress from Git Logs & Trackers

When automating this process using git logs or Jira/Linear tickets, apply the following filters:

- **Filter Noise:** Ignore trivial commits like "fix typo," "update readme," or merge commits unless they represent a significant milestone.
- **Aggregate Commits:** If there are 5 commits related to `#PROJ-123 Authentication`, summarize them into one bullet point: "Completed backend integration for Authentication flow (#PROJ-123)."
- **Highlight PRs:** Always mention Pull Requests that were opened, merged, or reviewed.

## 3. Keeping It Concise

Standup updates are not novels. They are designed for quick team alignment.

- **Limit details:** Avoid deep technical implementation details unless relevant to a blocker.
- **Max 3-5 bullets:** Per section (Yesterday/Today). If there is more, summarize the broader themes.
- **Example:**
  * *Too detailed:* "Wrote a SQL query using inner joins to connect the users table with the orders table, handled edge cases for null values, and added indexing to improve the query execution time by 400ms."
  * *Concise:* "Optimized user order history database queries, improving performance."

## 4. Highlighting Risks & Achievements

- **Achievements:** Did you finish a major epic or squash a nasty bug that plagued the team for weeks? Put it at the top of 'Yesterday' in bold.
- **Risks:** If a task is taking significantly longer than estimated, mention it in the 'Blockers' or 'Today' section as a risk so the team can offer help.

### Output Example

```markdown
**Yesterday:**
- Merged PR #452: Implemented OAuth2 login flow.
- Reviewed design docs for the new notification service.
- Fixed a memory leak in the image processing worker (Ticket #ENG-99).

**Today:**
- Pair programming with frontend team to integrate the OAuth2 endpoints.
- Draft database schema for the notification service.

**Blockers:**
- Waiting on DevOps to provision the staging environment for the notification service (Pinged @devops-team).
