# Secret Scanning and Management

## Overview
This skill focuses on detecting, managing, and preventing the leakage of sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, tokens, and certificates within the codebase and version control history.

## Core Principles

### 1. No Hardcoded Secrets
Source code should never contain sensitive data.
- **Separation of code and config:** Store configuration (including secrets) in the environment, separate from the application code (as per 12-Factor App principles).
- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env` files for local development but ensure they are strictly ignored in version control (`.gitignore`).

### 2. Secret Scanning
Actively scan the repository for accidentally committed secrets.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate tools like TruffleHog, Gitleaks, or GitHub Advanced Security into your CI pipeline to scan commits before they are merged.
- **Historical Scanning:** Scan the entire git history, not just the current state of the code, because deleted secrets in previous commits are still compromised.

### 3. Pre-commit Hooks
Prevent secrets from ever entering the git history.
- **Client-side checks:** Set up tools like `pre-commit` to run secret scanners locally before a developer can successfully commit code.

### 4. Secret Managers
Use dedicated systems to store and inject secrets at runtime.
- **Centralized Management:** Use solutions like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager.
- **Dynamic Secrets:** Where possible, prefer short-lived, dynamically generated credentials over long-lived static keys.

### 5. Remediation
If a secret is leaked, it must be considered compromised immediately.
- **Revoke and Rotate:** Never just delete the secret from the code. You must revoke the leaked key at the provider and generate a new one.

## Code Examples

### Setting up a Pre-commit Hook for Gitleaks
Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repository root:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks
    rev: v8.18.1
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
```

### Regular Expressions for Secret Detection
Example regex pattern to catch AWS Access Keys:
```regex
(?i)aws_access_key_id\s*=\s*(?P<key>AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16})
```

## Checklist for Secret Management
- [ ] Are all `.env` files and configuration files containing secrets added to `.gitignore`?
- [ ] Is a secret scanner (e.g., Gitleaks) configured in the CI/CD pipeline?
- [ ] Are pre-commit hooks configured to prevent developers from committing secrets locally?
- [ ] Are secrets retrieved from a secure Secret Manager in production rather than plain environment variables?
- [ ] Is there an established procedure to rotate secrets immediately if they are leaked?
