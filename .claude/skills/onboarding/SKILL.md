# User Onboarding Flow Design

Creating an effective onboarding experience is critical for user retention, feature discovery, and product success. A well-designed onboarding flow guides users to their "Aha!" moment as quickly as possible.

## 1. First-Time User Experience (FTUE) Patterns

FTUE sets the tone for the user's relationship with the product. Key patterns include:
- **Welcome Screens**: A warm greeting setting expectations and showcasing core value propositions.
- **Product Tours**: Guided walkthroughs of the interface.
- **Progressive Profiling**: Asking for user data incrementally rather than upfront.
- **Sandbox Environments**: Providing a safe, pre-populated space for users to experiment.
- **Checklists**: Gamified lists of tasks to guide initial actions.

## 2. Progressive Disclosure

Do not overwhelm the user. Reveal information and features only when they are needed.
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Show hints when a user interacts with or hovers over a new feature.
- **Just-in-Time Permissions**: Request permissions (camera, location, notifications) exactly when the feature requiring them is used, not immediately upon launch.
- **Advanced Features**: Hide complex settings behind "Advanced" toggles or menus until the user demonstrates basic proficiency.

## 3. Empty States

Empty states (e.g., a newly created inbox or an empty dashboard) are prime onboarding opportunities.
- **Educate**: Explain what will appear in this space.
- **Direct Action**: Provide clear primary CTAs (e.g., "Create your first project").
- **Provide Templates**: Offer starter content instead of starting from absolute zero.

## 4. Mobile App Permission Requests (iOS/Android Best Practices)

Mobile OS permissions can make or break an app. Rejection rates are high if handled poorly.
- **Prime the User**: Before showing the system dialogue, show a custom pre-prompt explaining *why* the permission is needed and *how* it benefits the user.
- **Delay Requests**: Never ask for push notifications or location access immediately after installation. Wait until the user performs an action that justifies it.
- **Graceful Degradation**: If permission is denied, ensure the app still functions in a limited capacity and provide a path to enable it later in settings.

## 5. Onboarding Anti-Patterns

Avoid these common mistakes:
- **The "Swipe-Through" Tutorial**: 5 screens of text before the user can use the app. Most users skip these.
- **Mandatory Account Creation for Everything**: Allow guest checkout or exploration before forcing signup if possible.
- **Overwhelming Tooltip Tours**: Blocking the screen with 10 sequential tooltips highlighting every button.
- **Information Overload**: Asking for phone number, address, and birthdate during step 1.

## 6. Activation Metrics

Measure onboarding success by tracking activation events:
- **Time to Value (TTV)**: How long it takes a user to complete their first core action.
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of users who finish the onboarding checklist.
- **Day 1 / Day 7 Retention**: Correlation between completing onboarding and returning to the app.

## 7. A/B Testing Strategies

Always test onboarding flows:
- **Length**: Test a 3-step vs 5-step signup process.
- **Copy**: Test value-based messaging vs feature-based messaging.
- **Order of Operations**: Test asking for payment upfront vs after a trial period.
- **Friction**: Test adding friction (e.g., asking qualifying questions) to see if it improves the quality of activated users.

## 8. Example Flow (SaaS Tool)
1. **Signup**: Email + Password (or SSO).
2. **Welcome Modal**: "What is your main goal today?" (Personalizes the dashboard).
3. **Empty State**: Dashboard with a "Create First Project" CTA.
4. **Action**: User clicks CTA -> Tooltip highlights the template library.
5. **Success State**: Project created -> Confetti animation -> "Invite a teammate" prompt.
