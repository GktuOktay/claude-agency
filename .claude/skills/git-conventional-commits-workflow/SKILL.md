# Git Conventional Commits Guide

This skill provides guidelines for writing clean, structured, and standardized commit messages and branch names using the Conventional Commits specification.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Always use descriptive and structured branch names. This helps in understanding the context of the work.

### Format
`<type>/<issue-ticket>-<short-description>`

### Types
- `feature/` or `feat/`: For new features
- `bugfix/` or `fix/`: For bug fixes
- `hotfix/`: For critical production fixes
- `chore/`: For maintenance, dependency updates, etc.
- `docs/`: For documentation changes

### Examples
- `feature/PROJ-123-add-user-login`
- `fix/PROJ-456-resolve-null-pointer`
- `chore/update-dependencies`

## Conventional Commits Specification

Commit messages should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

| Type       | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `feat`     | A new feature |
| `fix`      | A bug fix |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes |
| `style`    | Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `perf`     | A code change that improves performance |
| `test`     | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests |
| `build`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies |
| `ci`       | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts |
| `chore`    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit |

### Scope (Optional)
The scope provides context to where the changes were made (e.g., `auth`, `ui`, `database`).
Example: `feat(auth): implement JWT token verification`

### Description
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- Don't capitalize the first letter.
- No dot (.) at the end.

### Body (Optional)
- Just as in the description, use the imperative, present tense.
- The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Breaking Changes
A commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change.

Example:
```
feat(api)!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: The v1 endpoints are no longer available. Use v2 instead.
```

## Checklist for Good Commits
- [ ] Have I used the correct type?
- [ ] Is the description concise and clear?
- [ ] Did I use the imperative mood in the subject line?
- [ ] Have I included a body to explain the 'why' if necessary?
- [ ] Are breaking changes clearly marked?
