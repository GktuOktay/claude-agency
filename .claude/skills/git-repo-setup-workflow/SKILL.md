# GitHub Repository Setup and Community Standards

This skill covers the best practices for setting up a robust, welcoming, and standardized repository, especially for open-source or team-based projects.

## Essential Files

Every professional repository should include the following community health files at its root.

### 1. README.md
The entry point for the project. It should include:
- **Project Name and Description**: What it does.
- **Badges**: CI status, version, license.
- **Installation**: How to set it up locally.
- **Usage**: Basic examples of how to use the project.
- **Contributing**: Link to the contribution guidelines.
- **License**: The licensing information.

### 2. CONTRIBUTING.md
Guidelines for how others can contribute to the project.
- How to set up the dev environment.
- Coding standards and conventions.
- How to submit a Pull Request.
- How to report bugs (link to templates).

### 3. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
Establishes expectations for behavior within the community to ensure a welcoming environment. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a widely used standard.

### 4. LICENSE
Defines how others can use, modify, and distribute the code (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL).

## Issue and PR Templates

Templates help standardize the information provided by users and contributors. Create them in the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` directories.

- **Bug Report Template**: Prompts for steps to reproduce, environment, and expected behavior.
- **Feature Request Template**: Prompts for problem description and proposed solution.
- **PR Template**: Prompts for description, linked issues, and checklists.

## Repository Settings

Configure the repository settings to enforce quality and security.

### Branch Protection Rules (for `main` or `master`)
- **Require Pull Request reviews before merging**: Enforce at least 1-2 approvals.
- **Require status checks to pass before merging**: Ensure CI (tests, linters) passes.
- **Require conversation resolution before merging**: Ensure all review comments are addressed.
- **Require linear history**: Prevent merge commits if using squash/rebase strategy.
- **Include administrators**: Enforce these rules even for repo admins.

## Open Source Best Practices

- **Security Policy (`SECURITY.md`)**: Explain how to report security vulnerabilities responsibly.
- **Releases**: Use GitHub Releases with Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and clear changelogs.
- **Automated Workflows**: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD, linting, and stale issue management.
