# Clean Code & Production-Grade Code Reviewer

This skill eliminates technical debt and maximizes maintainability, readability, type safety, and production-grade code quality through deep code reviews, Google engineering standards, and refactoring patterns.

---

## 🧹 Refactoring & Engineering Principles

### 1. SOLID & Clean Code Standards
- **Single Responsibility (SRP):** Split overloaded files/functions into modular components.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstract duplicate code into reusable helpers or hooks.
- **KISS & YAGNI:** Avoid over-engineering; simplify overly complex abstractions.

### 2. Addy Osmani Production-Grade Standards
- **Zero Implicit State Mutation:** Never mutate global or private third-party state directly; keep mutations scoped and immutable.
- **Strict Guard Clauses:** Flatten nested `if/else` loops using early returns and validation gates.
- **Explicit Error Boundaries:** Never swallow exceptions or return dummy fallbacks silently; handle errors gracefully or propagate.
- **Type Safety Discipline:** Remove all `any` types; enforce strict TypeScript types and type guards.

### 3. Complexity Reduction & Naming
- **Intent-Revealing Naming:** Replace vague variables (`data`, `temp`, `x`) with domain-specific names.
- **Memory & Resource Safety:** Verify that all subscriptions, timers, and listeners have proper cleanup hooks.
